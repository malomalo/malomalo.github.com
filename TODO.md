- [Double Crunch Honey Garlic Chicken Breasts](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/26jdxy/double_crunch_honey_garlic_chicken_breasts/)
Ingredients:
4 Large boneless chicken breasts pounded down to 1/2 in thickness $
2 cup(s) Flour
4 teaspoon(s) salt
4 teaspoon(s) Black pepper
3 tablespoon(s) Ground Ginger
2 tablespoon(s) ground nutmeg
2 teaspoon(s) Ground thyme
2 teaspoon(s) ground sage
2 tablespoon(s) paprika
1 teaspoon(s) cayenne pepper
4 eggs
8 tablespoon(s) water
2 tablespoon(s) olive oil $
3-4 clove(s) garlic minced
1 cup(s) honey
1/4 cup(s) soya sauce
1 teaspoon(s) ground black pepper
Preparation:
Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, then dip the meat in the flour and spice mixture. Dip the breast into the eggwash (4 eggs & 8 tbsp water) and then a final time into the flour and spice mix, pressing the mix into the meat to get good contact.
Heat a skillet on the stove with about a half inch of canola oil covering the bottom. You will want to carefully regulate the temperature here so that the chicken does not brown too quickly. The thinness of the breast meat practically guarantees that it will be fully cooked by the time the outside is browned. I find just below medium heat works well. I use a burner setting of about 4 1/2 out of 10 on the dial and fry them gently for about 4 or 5 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy.
Drain on a wire rack for a couple of minutes before dipping the cooked breasts into the Honey Garlic Sauce. Serve with noodles or rice.
Honey Garlic Sauce
In a medium saucepan add:
2 tbsp olive oil
3 – 4 cloves minced garlic
Cook over medium heat to soften the garlic but do not let it brown. Add:
1 cup honey
¼ cup soya sauce (low sodium soya sauce is best)
1 tsp ground black pepper
Simmer together for 5-10 minutes, remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes. Watch this carefully as it simmers because it can foam up over the pot very easily.


- [jalapeño_cream_cheese_wontons](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/3b7176/jalape%C3%B1o_cream_cheese_wontons_recipe_in_comments/)

Makes: 25 pieces +/-
Ingredients:
1/2 cup Jalapeños, chopped (I used the pickled one cus I can’t find fresh ones)
1 cup Cream Cheese
Pinch of salt
25 wonton wrappers (might need more or less depending on how much you need)
Oil for deep frying
1tbsp cornflour
3 tbsp water
Directions:
Mix cornflour and water. Set aside. This is used for sealing the wonton wrappers. Mix jalapeños with cream cheese and salt. Take one wonton wrapper and fill it with about 2 tsp of jalapeño cream cheese mixture. Dip a finger in cornflour mixture and run it across the wrapper. Fold to make a triangle or desired shape. Gently press out any air pockets from the inside to avoid it the wontons from bursting while frying. Deep fry till golden brown.
Keep a good eye on the wontons while frying. They tend to get bubbly inside even with pressing out air pockets. You can bake these, but I tried it out at 200°C for 10 minutes and it was not as nice as the fried ones.
Enjoy!
