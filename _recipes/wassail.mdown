3 Hours

Ingredients:
------------

- 1 Gallon Apple Cider
- 2 Cups of Pineapple Juice
- 1/2 a Cup of Honey
- 1/2 a Cup of Sugar
- 2 Oranges
- Whole Cloves
- 1 Apple, peeled and diced
- Allspice
- Ginger
- Nutmeg
- 3 Cinnamon Sticks (or 3 Tbs. ground cinnamon)
- 1/2 Cup to 1 Cup of Brandy (optional)

Preparation:
------------

Set crockpot to its lower setting, and pour apple cider, pineapple juice,
honey and sugar in, mixing carefully. As it heats up, stir so that the
honey and sugar dissolve. Stud the oranges with the cloves (~6 cloves),
and place in the pot (they'll float). Add the diced apple. Add allspice,
ginger and nutmeg to taste -- usually a couple of tablespoons of each is
plenty. Finally, snap the cinnamon sticks in half and add those as well.

Cover your pot and allow to simmer 2 - 4 hours on low heat. About half
an hour prior to serving, add the brandy if you choose to use it.
